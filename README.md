# Qualification test

Write a simple demo R-package with Rcpp integration the purpose of which is just to perform the addition of numeric vectors using C++ function.

More specifically, we need the package to contain a high level R function, ex:

cppsum=function(x,y) {}

where x and y are two numeric vector of size n, and the function returns a size n vector containing x+y.
